### Hello my name is Vasily üëã
# Hi there, I'm [Your Name] üëã

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional web applications. Here's a little bit about what I do:

## Frontend Development üíª
I love bringing ideas to life on the screen. I work with:
- **JavaScript**: The language of the web, versatile and ever-evolving.
- **React**: Building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for production with server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and catching errors early.
- **HTML/CSS**: The building blocks of the web.
- **Less**: A preprocessor that extends the CSS language.
- **Sass/SCSS**: Making CSS fun again with nested rules and variables.
- **CSS Modules**: For locally scoped CSS.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
- And more...

## Backend Development üß∞
Creating robust backend systems is another forte. My toolkit includes:
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **MySQL**: The world's most popular open source database.
- **PostgreSQL**: An advanced open source relational database.
- And more...

## Tools & Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
To bring it all together, I use some of the best tools in the trade:
- **VS Code**: My code editor of choice for its speed and extensions.
- **npm/yarn**: Package management and script running.
- **Figma**: For designing interfaces and collaborating with designers.
- **Photoshop**: For editing images and creating graphics.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech, reading tech articles, or contributing to open source.
